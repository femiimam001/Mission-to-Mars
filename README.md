# Mission-to-Mars

# Overview of Project

Robin's a data scientist that does freelance astronomy work in her spare time.She spend a lot of time visiting web site with news about space exploration, especially the **mission to mars** .

In one of those days that she visits different the website's, an idea came to her that she could write a **script** that could gather all the information she seaches for into one convinient location.She had been admiring images of Mars’s hemispheres online and realized that the site is scraping-friendly.She would like to adjust the current web app to include all four of the hemisphere images.

In this project,I shall be helping Robin, and we shall be using BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.

## Resources And Tools

\*Data Source: Mission_to_Mars.ipynb, app.py, scraping.py and index.html

\*Data Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Python and MongoDB

\*Software: MongoDB, Python 3.8.3, Visual Studio Code 1.50.0, Flask Version 1.0.2

# Deliverable 1: Scrape Full-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles

## Deliverable Requirements:

Using BeautifulSoup and Splinter, you’ll scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images.

Make a copy of your Mission_to_Mars.ipynb file, and rename it Mission_to_Mars_Challenge.ipynb.
Download the Mission_to_Mars_Challenge_starter_code.ipynb, copy the starter code, and paste at the end of your Mission_to_Mars_Challenge.ipynb file.
​In Step 1, use your browser to visit the Mars Hemispheres website to view the hemisphere images.
Use the DevTools to inspect the page for the proper elements to scrape. You will need to retrieve the full-resolution image for each of Mars's hemispheres.
